In this project, we'll build a recommender system using different approaches(popular-based approach, collaborative filtering approach, and graph neural network approach). In this popular-based approach, we will filter out data and get the top and most popular items for users. This approach often use to create a top list for users to select items they might like. In collaborative filtering approach, the system will filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. This approach is often done by using matrix factorization. Matrix factorization is the approach of decomposing a matrix into the product of two or more matrices. Lastly, we can also use a graph neural network to build a recommender system. By using a neural network, we can update/adjust our weights of a matrix from matrix factorization to get an optimal ratings for each users. Graph neural networks has a advantage in recommender system. We can easily represent user-item interation by using a graph. In this project, we'd try all methods to build our recommender system. </br>
